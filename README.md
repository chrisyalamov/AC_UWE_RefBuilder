# UWE Bristol Reference Builder

This project is a small plugin for Atlassian Confluence I developed a few years ago. Confluence supports custom macros (elements which you can include in pages). This plugin offers a visual builder for references compliant with the University of the West of England, Bristol Harvard Referenceing Format which are formatted and included in Confluence Pages.

- 📱 **AtlasKit** for UI
